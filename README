This object can render text in HTML 5 canvas objects.
It can create a two dimension canvas object and renders text strings in it using given 
text style class definitions embedded in the text similar to HTML tags.  The style classes
can include definitions for rendering parameters like the text font, color, size and text
alignment.  The text style definitions can be cached to avoid the overhead of recomputing
the text styles.
